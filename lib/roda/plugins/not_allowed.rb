class Roda
  module RodaPlugins
    # The not_allowed plugin makes Roda attempt to automatically
    # support the 405 Method Not Allowed response status. The plugin
    # changes the +r.get+ and +r.post+ verb methods to automatically
    # return a 405 status if they are called with any arguments, and
    # the arguments match but the request method does not match. So
    # this code:
    #
    #   r.get '' do
    #     "a"
    #   end
    #
    # will return a 200 response for <tt>GET /</tt> and a 405
    # response for <tt>POST /</tt>.
    #
    # This plugin also changes the +r.is+ method so that if you use
    # a verb method inside +r.is+, it returns a 405 status if none
    # of the verb methods match.  So this code:
    #
    #   r.is '' do
    #     r.get do
    #       "a"
    #     end
    #
    #     r.post do
    #       "b"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # will return a 200 response for <tt>GET /</tt> and <tt>POST /</tt>,
    # but a 405 response for <tt>PUT /</tt>.
    #
    # Note that this plugin will probably not do what you want for
    # code such as:
    #
    #   r.get '' do
    #     "a"
    #   end
    #
    #   r.post '' do
    #     "b"
    #   end
    #
    # Since for a <tt>POST /</tt> request, when +r.get+ method matches
    # the path but not the request method, it will return an immediate
    # 405 response.  You must DRY up this code for it work correctly,
    # like this:
    #
    #   r.is '' do
    #     r.get do
    #       "a"
    #     end
    #
    #     r.post do
    #       "b"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # In all cases where it uses a 405 response, it also sets the +Allow+
    # header in the response to contain the request methods supported.
    # 
    # To make this affect the verb methods added by the all_verbs plugin,
    # load this plugin first.
    module NotAllowed
      # Redefine the +r.get+ and +r.post+ methods when loading the plugin.
