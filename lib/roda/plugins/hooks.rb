    # run code at the top of the route block:
    #
    #   route do |r|
    #     r.redirect('/login') unless logged_in?
    #     # ...
    #   end
    #
    # Note that the after hook is called with the rack response array
    # of status, headers, and body.  If it wants to change the response,
    # it must mutate this argument, calling <tt>response.status=</tt> inside
    # an after block will not affect the returned status.
    #
    # However, this code makes it easier to write after hooks, as well as
    # handle cases where before hooks are added after the route block.
