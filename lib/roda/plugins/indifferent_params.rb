class Roda

    # The indifferent_params plugin adds a +params+ instance
    # method which returns a copy of the request params hash
    # that will automatically convert symbols to strings.
    # Example:
    #
    #   plugin :indifferent_params
    #
    #   route do |r|
    #     params[:foo]
    #   end
    #
    # The params hash is initialized lazily, so you only pay
    # the penalty of copying the request params if you call
    # the +params+ method.
    #
    # Note that there is a rack-indifferent gem that
    # automatically makes rack use indifferent params. Using
    # rack-indifferent is faster and has some other minor
    # advantages over the indifferent_params plugin, though
    # it affects rack itself instead of just the Roda app that
    # you load the plugin into.
