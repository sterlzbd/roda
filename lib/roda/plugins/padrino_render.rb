    # The padrino_render plugin adds rendering support that is
    # similar to Padrino's.  While not everything Padrino's
    # rendering supports is supported by this plugin (yet), it
    # currently handles enough to be a drop in replacement for
    # some applications.
    #
    # Most notably, this makes the +render+ method default to
    # using the layout, similar to how the +view+ method works
    # in the render plugin.  If you want to call render and not
    # use a layout, you can use the <tt>:layout=>false</tt>
    # option:
    #
    #   render('test')                 # layout
    #   render('test', :layout=>false) # no layout
    #
    # This also adds a +partial+ method, which renders templates
    # without the layout, but prefixes the template filename to
    # use with an underscore:
    #
    #   partial('test')     # uses _test.erb
    #   partial('dir/test') # uses dir/_test.erb
    #
