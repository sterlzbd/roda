<h1>Why <span class="roda">Roda</span>?</h1>

<p>There are already plenty of ruby web frameworks. Why another one? Well, Roda has a very useful combination of features that make web development easy.  It's designed to be fast, <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>, and correct.  It's probably easiest to explain the advantages by comparing it with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, which it tries to emulate in many respects.</p>

<h2>Differences with Sinatra</h2>

<h3>Routing Tree</h3>

<p>The primary difference between Roda and Sinatra is that Roda uses a routing tree, while Sinatra uses a simple list of routes.  At any point in the routing tree, you can operate on the current route.  If your URLs reflect your application architecture, this allows you to have much DRYer code.  Let's examine code examples for a simple app, implemented in both Sinatra and Roda:</p>

<div class="col-md-6">
Roda:
<pre><code class="ruby">require 'roda'

class App &lt; Roda
  plugin :render

  route do |r|
    r.root do
      view :index
    end

    r.on 'artist/:id' do |artist_id|
      @artist = Artist[artist_id]

      r.is do
        r.get do
          view :artist
        end

        r.post do
          @artist.update(params[:artist])
          r.redirect(r.full_path_info)
        end
      end

      r.on 'album/:number' do |album_number|
        @album = @artist.album_with_number(album_number)

        r.is do
          r.get do
            view :album
          end

          r.post do
            @album.update(params[:album])
            r.redirect(r.full_path_info)
          end
        end

        r.on 'track/:track_num' do |track_num|
          @track = @album.track_with_number(track_num)

          r.is do
            r.get do 
              view :track
            end

            r.post do
              @track.update(params[:track])
              r.redirect(r.full_path_info)
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
Sinatra:
<pre><code class="ruby">require 'sinatra/base'

class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    erb :index
  end

  get '/artist/:id' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    erb :artist
  end

  post '/artist/:id' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    @artist.update(params[:artist])
    redirect(request.path_info)
  end

  get '/artist/:id/album/:number' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    @album = @artist.album_with_number(params[:number])
    erb :album
  end

  post '/artist/:id/album/:number' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    @album = @artist.album_with_number(params[:number])
    @album.update(params[:album])
    redirect(request.path_info)
  end

  get '/artist/:id/album/:number/track/:track_num' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    @album = @artist.album_with_number(params[:number])
    @track = @album.track_with_number(params[:track_num])
    erb :track
  end

  post '/artist/:id/album/:number/track/:track_num' do
    @artist = Artist[params[:id]]
    @album = @artist.album_with_number(params[:number])
    @track = @album.track_with_number(params[:track_num])
    @track.update(params[:track])
    redirect(request.path_info)
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear: both;">While the Roda code is slightly more lines, it should be apparent that it is actually much simpler.  Instead of setting the <span class="code">@artist</span>, <span class="code">@album</span>, and/or <span class="code">@track</span> variables in every route that uses them, the variables are set as soon as that branch of the tree is taken, and can be used in all routes under that branch.  This is why Roda is called a routing tree web framework. In all but the smallest applications, this usually results in much DRYer and easier to maintain code.</p>

<h3>Faster</h3>

<p>In addition to being more maintainable, Roda's approach is also faster in general.  This is because Sinatra is doing more work to determine which route to take compared to Roda.  Let's say you are going to <span class="path">/artist/1/album/2/track/3</span>.  What Sinatra is going to do is check each route in order, comparing the request method and route against the full path of the request, and if it doesn't match, starting again with the next route.  With Roda, as soon as part of the route matches, that part does not need to be rechecked every time.  Also, the request method is only checked once at the end to determine whether to take get or post as the final branch.</p>

<h3>Plugin System</h3>

<p>Another difference between Roda and Sinatra is that Roda has a plugin system modeled on <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net">Sequel</a>'s.  All parts of Roda (class/instance/request/response) can be overridden by plugins and call super to get the default behavior.  This includes when plugins are applied to the Roda class itself (affecting all subclasses).  Roda has a very small core, and many features that are built into Sinatra are shipped as plugins in Roda. This way they can easily used if needed, but if you don't use them you don't pay the cost for loading them.  Near the top of the Roda example, you can see <span class="code">plugin :render</span>, which adds support for template rendering, as the default Roda code doesn't ship with template support.</p>

<h3>Less Pollution</h3>

<p>Finally, Roda is very concerned about pollution.  In this case, pollution of the scope in which the route block operates.  Roda purposely limits the instance variables, instance methods, and class namespaces available in the route block scope, so that it is very unlikely you will run into conflicts.  If you've ever tried to use an instance variable named <span class="code">@request</span> or a model named <span class="code">Response</span> inside a <span class="code">Sinatra::Base</span> subclass, you'll appreciate that Roda attempts to avoid polluting the scope.</p>

<h2>Differences with Cuba</h2>

<p>Roda started out as a fork of <a href="http://cuba.is">Cuba</a>.  Both share the idea of using a routing tree, but there are some important differences.</p>

<h3>Response Bodies</h3>

<p>Cuba takes a explicit approach for handling response bodies, where you must always call <span class="code">res.write "body"</span> inside your routes.  Roda assumes that if the block returns a string and the response body has not already been written to, that the block response should be used as the response body.  This DRYs up a lot of code.  Here's a simple example:</p>

<div class="col-md-6">
Roda:
<pre><code class="ruby">Roda.route do |r|
  r.on 'foo' do
    '1'
  end

  r.on 'bar' do
    '2'
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
Cuba:
<pre><code class="ruby">Cuba.define do
  on 'foo' do
    res.write '1'
  end

  on 'bar' do
    res.write '2'
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Canonical Routes</h3>

<p>Roda has built in support for canonical routes using <span class="code">r.is</span>. Canonical in this case means no further entries are in the path.  In Cuba, if you want a canonical route, you have to manually use a regexp or string ending with <span class="code">\z</span>.  Using this example:</p>

<div class="col-md-6">
Roda:
<pre><code class="ruby">Roda.route do |r|
  r.is 'foo' do
    '1'
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
Cuba:
<pre><code class="ruby">Cuba.define do
  on 'foo' do
    res.write '1'
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Cuba will return a response of <span class="code">1</span> for <span class="path">/foo</span>, <span class="path">/foo/bar</span>, and <span class="path">/foo/bar/baz</span>, where Roda will only return a response of <span class="code">1</span> for <span class="path">/foo</span>, not handling <span class="path">/foo/bar</span> or <span class="path">/foo/bar/baz</span>.</p>

<h3>Less Pollution</h3>

<p>Roda makes more of an effort to avoid polluting the scope, though compared to most other web frameworks, Cuba does a good job.  With Cuba, all route matching methods are defined in the same scope, which has 23 additional methods over Object as opposed to the 6 additional methods in Roda.  Roda is able to do this by moving the route matching methods into the request class, which is why in Roda you use <span class="code">r.on</span> instead of <span class="code">on</span>. Cuba does not prefix instance variables or classes in the scope, which makes namespace clashes more likely.</p>

<h3>Plugin System</h3>

<p>While both Roda and Cuba have plugin systems, Roda's is based on <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net">Sequel</a>'s and is more flexible, allowing overriding of all Roda methods, even when plugins are used directly on the Roda class.  Additionally, Roda ships with many plugins, and those plugins are tested in the same test suite as the core Roda code, ensuring that updates to Roda will not break any of the plugins.</p>
